In this work, we  have focused on studying the properties and exploring the performance, quality and power/energy tradeoffs of Low-Mach-Number Combustion (LMC) application which is based Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) algorithm. The key contributions of this work are (1) we present an empirical evaluation of different configurations of application that gives insights into the energy-performance-quality tradeoff for this work, (2) we provided a comprehensive study of this LMC simulation performance, power and energy behavior, and (3) we propose a power-performance-quality tradeoff for this application, which can be used to better schedule power budgets across HPC systems.

Our current work investigates how to leverage these insights to implement a runtime to manage power budgets dynamically. Moreover, instead of trading-off with resolution, we also plan to explore the possibility of managing resources dynamically (e.g., cores) to manage power budgets. Future work also includes the management and scheduling of power budgets at whole system scale for assigning power budgets to other applications, not necessarily to the LMC workflow.
